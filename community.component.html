        <h1>Summer Camps</h1>
        <p> We believe that the best way to get children involved into the STEM field and robotics is through our
            direct guidence. Our partnership with the STTE foundation was able to provide several 
            robotics summer camps throughout the summer of 2019. In these summer camps we taught the participants 
            the engineering process and how to apply it robotics.

        <h1>Scottsdale Elementary</h1>
        <p>
            Our guidence begins in the earliest level of grade school, elementary. Our members have decided that 
            we are to take resposibility for the guidence of all the schools that corralate to Eastwood High School. 
            We have taught the students of Scottsdale elementary the basics of robotics through Vex IQ, the earliest 
            level of competition for students provided by Vex. Students of Scottsdale are under the supervision of 
            Euince Torres and are guided by our memebers. We believe that elementary is an important part of students 
            lives and is also the best stage to incorporate valuable lesons. Not only do the students learn the basics 
            of robotics and the engineering process as well as providing an early introduction to the STEM field, but
            students learn the importance of team work, responsibility, hard work, and humility. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>Eastwood Middle School</h1>
        <p> In the last two years, Eastwood Robotics has guided the Eastwood Middle School Robotics into success. 
            As the highest level of grades school we believe it is our resposibility to get those younger than us 
            into discovering their intrest in robotics. Eastwood Robotics tought the members of the Eastwood Middle 
            School Robotics how to cad, program, build, drive, and the engineering process and its application to 
            robotics. Our members have also taught the Eastwood Middle School Robotics team how to create an award 
            winning notebook. 
        </p>

        <p> Our memebers decided that Eastwood Middle School was ready for a challange. For this reason we decided 
            to teach the Eastwood Middle School how to compete in the VEX EDR competitions alongside the rest of the 
            Eastwood High School Robotics teams. Eastwood Middle School Robotics was extremely successful in their first 
            year competing in the EDR competitions winning the excellence award in December of 2019 and qualifing for state.   
            Unfortunetly Eastwood Middle School Robotics was not able to compete in the state competition due to the rise of 
            COVID-19. However we are proud to recognize this group of young individuals that will be the future of Eastwood 
            Robotics 8787.
